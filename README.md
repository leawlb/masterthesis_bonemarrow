Code contains source code.

Figures contains all .Rmd scripts for figure creation for download of figure parts to be assembled manually in Inkscape.

Interactome contains scripts for cell type pair (CTP) interactome calculation and analysis and all required functions.

Transcriptome contains individual pre-processing of the provided scRNAseq datasets, including changes of cell type names.
